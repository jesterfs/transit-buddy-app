Summary: Transit Buddy is a tool for transit riders to see what obstacles they might encounter on their commute and report any obstacles they encounter.
These reports last for three days or until a certain number of unique users report them as resolved.


The user can navigate to their preferred transit line and select a station from the map. (seen below)

Upon selecting a station, the user can see active obstacles, report them as resolved, or file a report of their own.
